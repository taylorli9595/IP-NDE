The adversarial attack makes the image recovery of deep learning methods significantly less effective when the speckle noise distribution is almost unchanged. In purpose of addressing the above problem, we propose a diffusion equation-based speckle removal model that can improve the robustness of deep learning algorithms in this paper.
